# Fradulent_Transaction_Prediction
Machine Learning model to predict and classify fraudulent transactions. 
This repository contains the python notebook with python code for handling the dataset, model building and results of traing and testing.
Also, data visualization graphs will be present that'd explain the dataset.

Considering the size of the dataset used, it cannot be uploaded in the github, I'm providing the dataset source link below for reference.
